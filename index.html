                    I'm a 3/4ths Asian, 1/4th Caucasian girl living in the Silicon Valley. I was born in the city of Chicago and raised in its surrounding areas until 2010, when I formally moved to California.

                        Pair-programming is a classic win-win. Mutual reinforcement of the concepts for both parties, and minimum viable product standards are met? Yes, please!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web designs that provide peace of mind are my goal. Too often I find myself second-guessing color gradients, color palettes, etc.

                    <li>
                        I've maintained 2 websites for local clubs, for a total of 3 years, and hopefully more to come. :)

                            I like taking photos, primarily of roses and the environment during my hikes.

                            I poorly dance to the music I like quite often at odd hours. Better than working out!
